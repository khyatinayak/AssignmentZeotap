# Customer Segmentation, Lookalike Modeling, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the solutions and code for the following tasks:
Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Lookalike Modeling for Customer Acquisition
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Data

# Overview

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: To analyze the customer dataset and uncover key insights about customer behavior.
Methodology: Various EDA techniques such as summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis were applied.
Results: The EDA revealed trends and patterns in customer data, which are essential for data-driven decision-making. 

Task 2: Lookalike Modeling for Customer Acquisition
Objective: To identify potential customers that resemble existing high-value customers.
Methodology: Using machine learning techniques, a lookalike model was built based on the behavior and demographics of high-value customers.
Results: The model helps in targeting new prospects similar to top-performing customers, improving marketing and sales strategies.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation
Objective: To segment customers based on their spending behavior and demographic data.
Methodology: K-Means Clustering was applied to segment customers into distinct groups. The optimal number of clusters was determined using metrics such as the Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) and the Silhouette Score.
Results: The customer segments provide valuable insights into different types of consumers, with recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.
